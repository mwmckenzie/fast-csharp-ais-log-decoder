# Fast C# AIS Log Decoder

## Purpose 

This project builds on a series of efforts to increase the speed and efficiency of processing large amounts of raw AIS log data.

## Description

This test project is built as a C# console application.

The console application has four primary segments, controlled via bool settings in [program.cs](https://github.com/mwmckenzie/fast-csharp-ais-log-decoder/blob/main/AisDataProcessing/Program.cs). There is a built-in stopwatch functionality which prints the total run-time to the console after every successful application execution.

## Primary Application Segments
